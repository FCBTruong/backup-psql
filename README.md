- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: Practice restoring databases to a specific point in time using pgBarman.
- **Incremental Backups**: Implement incremental backups to optimize storage and backup time.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Configure pgBarman to monitor backup status and generate alerts.

## Tools and Technologies
